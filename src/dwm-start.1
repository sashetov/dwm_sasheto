.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwm\-start
.SH DESCRIPTION
dwm\-start is a helper script for running and reconfiguring
.BR dwm
if neccessarry. It's the preferred way of starting
.BR dwm
in Fedora.
.P
Running
.BR dwm-start
starts the Fedora build by default.  If you wish to customize your
configuration, put the dwm config header file to $HOME/.dwm/config.h and
adjust it according to your needs.  The official Fedora configuration file
might be a useful template.
See the
.BR FILES
section of this manual.

Every time the user configuration file has changed or new patches have been
added,
.BR dwm\-start
will rebuild the user dwm binary prior to its execution.
